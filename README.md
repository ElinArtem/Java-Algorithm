# <div align="center">Java-Algorithm</div>

A collection of Java implementations for fundamental algorithms, including brute-force techniques, recursion, and sorting algorithms. This repository serves as a learning resource and reference for algorithmic approaches in Java.

## Contents

- **BruteForceFindMaxValue.java** - Implements a brute-force approach to find the maximum value in a list.
- **BruteForcePatternMatching.java** - Uses brute-force pattern matching to search for a pattern within a string.
- **RecursiveFactorial.java** - Computes the factorial of a number using recursion.
- **RecursiveFibonacci.java** - Computes Fibonacci numbers using a recursive approach.
- **SelectionSort.java** - Implements the selection sort algorithm to sort an array of values.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash git clone https://github.com/ElinArtem/Java-Algorithm.git```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run individual .java files to test each algorithm.

## Requirements

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in a self-contained .java file. Simply run the file to see the output or incorporate the methods into larger projects.
